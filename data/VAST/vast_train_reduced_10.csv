amanda,"Violence is inherent in the sex industry only in the same way that criminality is inherent in business in Russia. All private business in Russia was illegal under communism, so when communism fell, the first and strongest entrants were people from criminal backgrounds who had already been engaging in it illegally.

Phil NH,"I have two serious issues with plug-in cars, local and national. Locally, NH has the highest electric rates in the country (thanks, Seabrook). Nationally, plugging in is a huge waste of energy. To get a gallon of gas worth of electricity out of a wall socket, we need to put at least three gallons into the generator.

Tom Williford,"A ratings system that leads to accountability seems to be the Obama administration's backdoor attempt to control the for-profits, who are, by and large, giving out junk degrees while raking in the federal loans.

So Obama is proposing a compromise--rate all of the universities and decide on federal loans from there.

Just a thought,"I encounter deaf people from time to time in my work. I mistakenly believed that in this day of texting and email, that communicating with them would not be a problem. What I didn't realize is that when ASL is your first language, English is a foreign language. As such, the deaf people I have encountered were not well able to communicate in writing. I'm not saying they couldn't write a 10 page memo; they couldn't answer simple questions in an email. It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it.

David Underwood,"So this thesis is ""Once a felon, always a felon?"" The stated purpose of incarceration correction. In California it is the CDC or California Department of Corrections, not the prison department. A convict is released, put on parole, satisfies the requirements, and is expected to become a normal member of society. But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have. He/she is in effect no longer a whole citizen, even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court. So even though his behavior has been corrected he/she is treated as uncorrected. Worse yet, in many cases they can not get certain work, are relegated to the lower levels of society, yet expected to be productive. So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration? Some may be career criminals, but as we have seen fr to many times, most are not, but in many cases return to crime as that is what they know best.

tom mcmahon,"it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't.

dave,"The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence. Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids.

Paige LoVoi,I believe that declawing cats is animal abuse. Claws are a cats first line of defense and without their claws they are defenseless. I wish they would make this illegal everywhere. It is selfish for owners to do this. I have two cats who came to me already declawed and I worry that if I did not take them in they would be stray outside cats and probably would not survive. Also one of my cats loves sitting outside in the flower pot and would love to be outside more to explore and fully experience cat behaviors if she had her claws. It is also incredibly painful for the animal and even today just touching my declawed cats front paws makes her wince. If furniture is such a priority maybe you shouldn't have pets or keep them in a different area of your home. Declawing cats fingernails in my mind is equal to removing our feet and hands.

jojojo12,"Boys drop out of school at a much higher rate than girls. Boys and young men are 7 times more likely than girls and young women to commit suicide.

Elena,"Playing Varsity Lacrosse in college saved me. It was the very best thing I could have done. It kept me focused, gave me a great group of friends, challenged me both physically and mentally, taught me a lot about trust and teamwork and propelled me through school. It was an incredible outlet for my energy and competitive spirt. I still to this day, believe many of my personal and professional strengths were developed by playing sports. The NCAA, without a doubt, needs to change. There is far too much money spent around the NCAA and the culture at top levels can be nasty and unattractive. But that doesn't that mean that Varsity Sports should be cut from colleges and that Varsity athletes should be punished.

BCW,The single largest source of capital for companies is the profits on the things they sell. The beatification of stock investors proves only that the very wealthy control the debate. The claim that the wealthy will go Galt with their money if capital gains taxes are raised let alone not lowered is simply stupid: where would they go? The wealthy have enough money that they can live were they want irrespective of the cost - they choose to live in America because we have a country that collects enough taxes to function reasonably well. If only taxes mattered the wealthy would live in Haiti or other tax paradises. The Cato institute lobbying group points at data showing capital outflows but deliberately neglects the nearly equivalent inflows from other countries.

Richard,Home schooled students should take and pass the same tests as do their public school peers.

DaveW,"#1, children educated at home turn out to be better socialized than their public schooled counterparts. They are more likely to vote, more likely to get involved in government, and more likely to volunteer for various charitable activities. And, on average, they are better educated. Sending one's children to a public school is on average, the bad decision. While there are good public schools and good public school teachers, there are also countless schools where children do not learn, are not safe (from other students and teachers), and do not get properly socialized. I know this from countless studies and personal experience. My three children, educated at home from birth, are all national merit finalists and prepared to deal with people in the real world because they were in the real world their entire lives, rather than being segregated by age and demographic in a public (aka government compulsory) school.

Keep the employees happy through good treatment and keep clients happy through relationships that go beyond the single sales person.

Dee,"Hollow argument. I am radically opposed to drunk driving, but using drunk driving as an argument against happy hours is not applicable in any city with a good public transit system - e.g Chicago. I've seen fans at sporting events (in Chicago) consume much more beer than most people could consume during happy hour; yet the only restrictions at ballparks, stadiums, and arenas are stopping sales at a point late in the game. So the guzzlers stock up before that point. When I've seen these types, I've always hoped they were taking public transit. Public transit systems and their passengers don't want to deal with drunks either. And the general RESPONSIBLE population should not be penalized by the irresponsible few.

JayJay,"That this pretends to be a serious discussions is proof of how twisted American policy is in the Middle East. To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington. Things are so warped that the president can't even seriously oppose new settlements in the West Bank -- which continue to be built in defiance of US policy -- without being attacked as an Arab stooge. There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer.

Harmon Bryen,"I have never understood the concept of the tax advantaged capital gain. Some say the gain has already been taxed when the income ws earned to make the investment. By that standard, only ordinary w-2 income should be taxed at standard marginal rates. A person who purchases 100 shares of XYZ for $50.00 a share and sells it to another investor for $100.00 a share makes $50.00 a share. Not one penny goes to XYZ company to, say, purchase equipment or even better, hire another employee (unless of course it's an IPO).

Jimmy Cracked Corns,It is the same large corporate institutions that pushed for outsourcing military functions that have caused skyrocketing costs to provide basic logistics and services in forward deployed units.

Bill,"I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch electric travel for the masses. For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles.

Juices, along with meat and egg replacements are all healthy, vitamin-rich, vegan options.

tigermom,"I have been successful at both obtaining tenure, academic prestige and children (late, admittedly). The advice I might offer aspiring young women is to find a younger man who is not particularly ambitious or career-focused and who loves kids and homelife.

Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days.

Pierce Randall,"""[T]here were 1.5 million fewer native-born Americans working than in November 2007, while 2 million more immigrants (legal and illegal) were working. Thus, all net employment gains since November 2007 have gone to immigrants."" That's a woefully fallacious inference. What's a ""net employment gain""? You can't have a gain without an idea of a baseline--what is the relevant level against which we say that we have gained jobs? We have no idea what the jobs situation would be like without those 2 million immigrants; it could be that without those immigrants buying goods and services, we would have even less employment for non-immgrant workers.

Navigator,"I am surprised by the naivete of many commenters and even some contributors. The business of NY is real estate and the banks that finance it. Much like the business of Washington is government and the business of Las Vegas is gambling.

Ours is not a national capital like London, Paris, or Berlin. We are a business city and have to generate as well as spend money. NY has been very good at both things for many decades.

Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed.

Eugene,"In today's Western world, almost all children survive to adulthood, thanks to good medical care, no wars, and a much better standard of living.

In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest.

Patrick,"My wife and I are long-time vegans raising a healthy vegan child. Our wonderful daughter is above-average in height and in the 95th percentile in head size. She has hit virtually every developmental milestone at least a month ahead of average, and she has been regularly declared healthy and above average by our pediatrician, who has decades of experience with thousands of children and who has declared that he is comfortable with our vegan choice. We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning.

Bob,"I have taught at elite universities for the past 43 years. Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior.

Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades.

Joe,"I should not be surprised at the high level of naive, inaccurate and incorrect comments. Some of these readers need to research about what they believe about electric cars. Some misconceptions are that batteries don't last that long (they do and are easily recyclable), biodiesel is a viable fuel source of trans fuel for the planet (will not hardly make a dent in demand), fuel cells technology is possible soon (long way off), environmentalists are responsible for keeping diesel cars out of the USA (VW is selling them and the EPA is responsible for clean air.) Electric costs will go up.

Goose,"As a former Principal of a large public high school I am appalled at what I've read re the holding back of the female student.

casual observer,The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own.

college senior,"If laws like this are a good way of dealing with reality, I'll stick to reading fiction. Public schools do differentiate between students! Most schools have AP classes, gifted programs, etc. Even elementary and middle schools have talented and gifted programs and/or challenge courses. How much students care to learn also affects how much they end up learning. I'm quite confused what is good about this idea of yours as it seems to equate public education to shoe shopping.

Tom,"Of course individuals with dual citizenship can be model citizens, that is until the policies of their two countries conflict. Those things don't normally happen for most people, unless they work for the government. My wife had dual citizenship, but when she began working for the U.S. Department of State she was asked to renounce the non-US one in order to get a security clearance. Back in my military career, it was common for foreign nationals to enlist, but hey did not get a Secret clearance until they became U.S. citizens and renounced their birth citizenship. That clearance was critical to becoming a non-commissioned officer or commissioned officer.

Stephen J,"Mr. Jaffe seems to be confusing three very different situations. Parents of minor children already have the right to know what is going on with their children's care. And people who have been appointed as legal guardians (conservators of person) also have this right; naturally, that includes parents of adults who have been judged incompetent to manage their own affairs (in probate court), unless someone else (such as a spouse, adult child, lawyer, or physician) takes that responsibility. Done deal! The third case is that of an adult who suffers from a mental illness but has not been found legally incompetent. That person has exactly the same rights and responsibilities as anyone else. Of course one's doctors, lawyers, accountants, priests, and (for that matter) barbers do not communicate with our parents about one's decisions! Why should they?

Kevin Wires,There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains. The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason. The military strength of the country eliminates the thought of a takeover which would change potential ownership of ones own wealth. This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here. The rich's desire to return to feudalism where the poor carry the full burden of Government expense. Why is interest and dividend income less taxable than a workers paycheck?

Kevin Wires,There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains. The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason. The military strength of the country eliminates the thought of a takeover which would change potential ownership of ones own wealth. This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here. The rich's desire to return to feudalism where the poor carry the full burden of Government expense. Why is interest and dividend income less taxable than a workers paycheck? We fight many of our wars to protect the investments and projects of one or another rich group or company. It only makes sense that the rich contribute to the upkeep and maintenance of the country.

Kurt,"If we are that dependent upon the labor of immigrants (and I suspect we are), we should formalize the terms of our mutual interests by expanding the numbers of those allowed into the country to work legally while also enforcing the immigration laws to ensure those quotas are not exceeded.

Mike R,"Contrary to popular belief, there is no mandatory voting in Australia. Adults are required to attend a polling station, to produce identification, and to have their name crossed off the electoral roll.

SA,"The cost of schooling children is not shared by parents, it is shared by all taxpayers. Those of us who have no children in the public school system don't get a tax break on that basis. The reason for that is simple: we all benefit from having a well-educated electorate and a well-educated workforce. In paying the taxes that cover the cost of education we both pay it back and pay it forward: repayment for the education we've received, and payment for the children in our communities who'll grow up to be productive members of our society. It's a very large part of the reason that this has been seen as the land of opportunity: Education is free, and open to all. The parents who home-school their children may be helping in their effort, but they are just as responsible for those of us with no school-age children for ensuring the education of ALL children.

SoCal Observer,"Blacks sold blacks into European/American slavery. The African tradition of slavery still persists in many parts of Africa. Mauritania leads with an estimated 10-20% of the population in slavery. Move on liberals ..... focus on today's slavery and the cultural issues that face Africa. How about focusing on today's sex slavery in the US in most major cities. Modern efforts to atone such as the Pigford Settlement are a total embarrassment and an under-reported scandal costing taxpayers $4-5 Billion.

What parents seem to consider is the here and now, not what may be better for the deaf child when they become an adult. For example. I was raised in an oral program. My parents believed as this was a hearing world, I needed to learn to be in a hearing world. That was fine until I became an adult and had my own children. While both of my children are hearing, due to complications in my pregnancy, I lost most of my residual hearing and while my speech was incredible, I couldn't understand anyone.

fs,"Former Nobel economist Milton Friedman once said that the main purpose of government, with regard to illegal, black-market drugs, was to serve as a protection force for illegal drug cartels.

Meredith,"I believe it's true that Prozac along with talk therapy has been more effective than either alone for many depressed people. And not years of psychoanalysis either, but limited time cognitive therapy. The Prozac lessens the feeling of being out of control, subject to moods with little power over them. Then once that takes effect, the person can benefit from therapy, gaining some objectivity and distance from what had previously overwhelmed them. This may suffice, and also lead to taking positive steps to improve their lives, which would have been impossible without the stabilizing effect of Prozac drugs. Budget cutting has lessened availability of mental health treatment, leading to crime, violence, family pathology and incarceration. We should study the methods used in the many countries with universal tax supported health care.

Michael,"""Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race."" Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument.

C Wolfe,"""It is unclear that it has created a populace significantly better informed or intellectually curious."" Such a sad but true statement about post-WW2 higher education. I came to this opinion prepared to stomp on it, but find that I agree. In theory.

LBarr,"As Caroline Glicks less than artful use of quotation marks demonstrates, many people, especially Israelis are unwilling to even recognize the existence of the Palestinian people, let alone state. Much easier to appropriate land and refuse to respect anothers basic human rights if you refuse to admit they are even there, or fully human. First and foremost should be the full recognition that a people can be defined by any name they choose and have the right to a voice in establishing their future and a right to equal status under the law. Just as the fact there was no Israel, or Israelis 100 years ago doesn't negate that nations right to self determination, so the same should be for the Palestinians. Nations should recognize the Palestinian people and their right to not be held in legal limbo.

Alix Woznick,"As a school librarian who enjoys working with our local public library system, I think there is a lot to be said for looking at ways for the two to work together more closely to best serve our students, not as a cost-saving measure. Can we deliver better service and aid student achievement by joining up more effectively? But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services.

Wes Fowler,"I agree with Mr. DeLorenzo, range anxiety is a huge issue with EV's. The current technology does not provide an affordable energy storage system. I am aware that Tesla has an EV capable of 300 miles per charge but the current model starts at $101,500, however they have another model scheduled to debut in 2012 for $49,000 (including a $7,500 tax credit). Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas.

Michael,"I couldn't agree more with Wygant's broader argument. What in the world is happening to us? About six months ago I attended a training course for new employees at the university where I work. I arrived about fifteen minutes early, as did about twenty other people. During the entire fifteen minutes before the instructor arrived and started the class, no one said a thing. They all watched videos, listened to music, or checked email on their smart phones. Real-world encounters and conversations are how members of the opposite sex meet each other and build relationships. But if I see someone engrossed in facebook or instant messaging, no matter how attractive she is, I will simply assume she doesn't want to be bothered. These technologies are very chick and very smart, but what we are in denial about is that they work to inhibit real world communication between human beings rather than promote it. It is a means of shutting out the world.

nl7,"I don't comprehend the anger and vitriol. It comes across as a very conservative sense of entitlement. A restaurant is paying for food, drinks, service, ambience, seating, location, and a million other things.

Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive? It seems as silly to me as being angry that somebody who ordered lobster and whiskey pays more than somebody who got a sandwich and water.

anonymous in texas,"I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life.

I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time.

Tal Barzilai,"Just like the BDS, this group does the usual, it's always Israel's fault and they must be boycotted if they refuse. Does Hijab understand the real issue or just what agrees with her side only? Most countries aren't fooled by what she says and know that boycotting Israel does more harm than benefit. By calling on a boycott to Israel, you will lose a lot of medical and technological advances that they are creating. Of course, she probably doesn't care about other countries that show much more signs of oppression to minority groups be it the Kurds, Tibetan Monks, or any others. However, there are no calls to boycott those countries, which is more proof of anti-semitism. I wonder what she thinks about Syria killing a lot more civilians on a higher scale or even Russia for what's going on Ukraine. My answer is probably nothing. Also, many of what happens to the Gaza Strip is because Hamas has a long history of placing their own kind into harm's way while they are hiding in safe shelters and tunnels that their people aren't allowed to use.

""Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat"". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton.

Steve,The increase in heroin use has nothing to do with marijuana. It is irresponsible to even suggest that. The increase in use was caused by the prescription drug oxycodone.

La Rosser,"In my opinion, the primary goal of parenting is to make a child ready to live a productive, independent and personally satisfying life. Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal. Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons.

Karen R,"So much of the debate focuses on when to give birth. Very little discussion addresses what happens next. I had my two children in my mid-thirties; quite the norm for professional women. Now I am in my fifties, dealing with teenagers who need me almost as much as an infant does-late nights, multiple crises, job interruptions, feeding, talking to, sturm und drang; as well as aging parents who also delayed childbirth till later in life. My husband's and my parents are older than most, more fragile, grappling with health issues, dementia, financial, housing, and end-of-life difficulties.

David Iverson,"I make a modest wage, but because of being a life-long investor I have a good portfolio. About $40k of my income comes from my salary and $10k comes from investments. For that $40k I get up in the morning, drive to the office and work hard for eight hours every day. For that $10k in capital gains all I do is spend thirty seconds a month transferring money from my checking account to my mutual fund accounts.

chip,"This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses.

Karen,"Does the Center for Immigration Studies actually study or conduct research on anything, immigration or otherwise? I don't think so. So why is this group, which contrary to actual principles of research and study has already drawn its conclusions, invited to give comment on a perfectly legitimate question?

mancuroc,"At last! Someone is talking about Iran in relations to its ally Syria. But the last thing we need is some armchair warmonger suggesting we exploit Syria to bring Iran to heel. This is exactly the wrong prescription. It will stir the pot in the region even more. The US has yet to respond (in public, at least) to the election of a relative moderate as Iran's president. Iran has shown some embarrassment at the use of chemical weapons in Syria. A bit of diplomacy would be in order.

Nancy Anthony,"I have to agree with Wurman to the extent that ""If we are to have any hope of meaningfully increasing the literacy of our students, the solution must lie with classroom teachers and not with libraries and librarians."" What he neglects to include, however, is how important the school librarian can be in ensuring that teachers have the necessary resources and skills to work with students in improving literacy.

This is the case, because it is seems impossible to understand how meaning is made with language without having studied a language other than one's own. To encounter a word or a phrase we don't understand is often the very first step in making sense of a culture other than our own, whether a contemporary culture or one that existed in the different past. Studying a language, moreover, helps us understand better who we are by recognizing that there are ideas that we can't quite express in our own tongue. And even if we make good progress in the study of a language other than our own, we are constantly reminded of how little we in fact understand about another tongue, another system of thought, a foreign vocabulary.

Reality-Check,"This debater, and his opinion in this article, betray a very weak understanding of history. Nato expanded into the former Soviet Union long ago. The majority of the former Soviet Block eastern European countries are already part of NATO. Ukraine is the largest country in Europe, and potentially one of the Richest, if you do not count the European portion of Russia. Standing by, and not helping Ukraine to defended itself against Russia, would be wrong from national security, economic and moral points of view.

aj,"Mr. van Doren utterly disregards the ancillary improvements that will come when electric vehicles become a huge market, and automobile improvements begin to come from the realm of electronics and materials.

Dave McCombs,"It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers.

I delivered my two girls with the least interventions (no drugs or other interventions). Every single thing the doctors did, I was asked first... Except... my second daughter was entangled in her cord. The doctor immediately helped her out with vacuum. Today, she has no lesions or side effects.

Dick Dowdell,"Free market forces work well when there is a direct and obvious connection between the purchase and the consumption of goods and services. Not so well, when the provider of the goods and services is able to hide price behind layers of obfuscation and indirection.

It is like grocery stores that offered all their food for free to pull the most possible customers from competitors. But then they charge random cars in the parking lot $100 for parking more than 10 minutes.

SB,"I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few.

Daddio7,No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor. The business owner had the opinion that the blacks didn't work hard enough and were a lot of trouble. Five or six of the most reliable blacks were kept. Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country.

Winthrop Staples,"This nation is going to have to admit that its tradition of luring more than a million poor unskilled immigrants to this country a year, with the express purpose of exploiting them with below living wage wages (and then taxing our dwindling middle class to get social service subsidies needed to keep them alive), is complex comoflaged form of slavery that is no more moral than the formal black slavery that so oppressed and humiliated our nation. It must stop now. If we have to pay a bit more for food so be it. No one accepts former complaints that ending black slavery would raise the cost of cotton cloth, so why do we dare mention the cost of ending agricultural worker slavery.

swp,"Great article. Arrest should be devoted to people who need social resource. That may mean help, control, or both. It changes people for the better and build trust. People are happier when they know their enforcement of the law is building bridges in communities that may need help. Everyone deserves objective feedback, no one deserves to be abused.

Some of these items are separately charged for, such as the food and drinks one orders, while others are recouped by unallocated charges on your bill. Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive?

Iran has shown some embarrassment at the use of chemical weapons in Syria. A bit of diplomacy would be in order.

fly4val,"Many years ago, I stepped into a marriage where there was a 13 year old girl, long without a father or father figure. School for her was a disaster, 1.7 GPA, held back a year, lacking cleanliness or home skills. I took away the tv and the video games and required her to bring home a signed assignment sheet every school day. Meetings with teachers indicated she was an 80% child that was lacking (lazy) in doing her school work. After I entered her life, she rapidly ramped up, cleaned up with daily showers and grades climbed significantly to where she earned a 3.4 the following year and was handling AP classes with ease.All this while being on the rowing team at her school.
