# Files:
"processed_annotated*.csv" - Examples with oracle attribution scores ("weights"). See ../../vast_reader.py for usage.
"special_datapoints*.txt" - Examples whose ids ("new_id") should be ignored in main_csv. These examples are either present in the processed_annotated file or intended to be removed from the dataset.
